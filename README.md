<h3>T.B.C</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Advanced filtering -> current UI needs some retouching if going to be used for the time being.
	</li>
	<li>
		Paging results. -> pass var to list page.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add none option to Group filter. This will be critical for certain view types.
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		Mappings are not cleaned up for removed items / groups / suppliers - this is most evident on the mapping table.
	</li>
</ul>
